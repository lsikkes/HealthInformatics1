NOTE! We use VISUAL STUDIO 2013, any edition should work fine. 

1. StyleCop. This makes sure our code has the same and desired syntax. This can be installed from https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/cac2a05b-6eb6-4fa2-95b9-1f8d011e6cae
2. NUnit. This is our testing framework. It can be downloaden from http://nunit.org/?p=download. The msi file.
3. To run the NUnit test an adapter is needed. This can be installed from VS2013. Go to Tools -> Extensions and updates (in the middle) -> online and search then for "NUnit adapter". Instal then NUnit 3 test adapter. The normal test running tool in VS should now also run NUnit tests.
4. We also use Productivity Power Tools 2013, GhostDoc and CodeMaid. This cannot be checked that we use it. As it does not generate reports. The power tools give us some extra buttons to use. GhostDoc is helping us to create comments/documentation. CodeMaid cleans up our code to reduce StyleCop warnings.
